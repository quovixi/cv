        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <div class="lead">
            <p>I'm an experienced product manager with a passion for crafting user-friendly software that makes people's lives easier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
            <p>I joined <a href="https://ti.to/home" target="_blank">Tito</a> in 2018, initially as customer experience lead having been an early customer myself. Within two years, I'd advanced to the leadership team, taking on various responsibilities across product operations, customer support, and sales and marketing. I've managed the product team since 2021, leading on our product strategy and processes.</p>
            <p>My primary responsibility is to oversee the delivery of our suite of events-focused software products, setting direction, prioritizing projects, and line-managing the product delivery team (currently three engineers). I lead weekly product meetings, develop specs and wireframes, triage the backlog, review and test new features, and write documentation.</p>
            <p>Working for a small company means I often have the opportunity to take the lead on other, product-adjacent initiatives, and collaborate on company-wide strategy, including pricing, recruitment, and procurement. I regularly undertake customer support duties and sometimes call upon experience gained in marketing roles prior to Tito to contribute to copywriting, graphic design, video editing, and produce and deliver sales and training presentations. Occasionally, I use my fledgling programming skills to contribute to our codebase directly, which always gives me a thrill!</p>
            <p>My work history and education is varied, covering everything from theatre studies to youth work and criminology to marketing, but the one constant is that Iâ€™ve always been drawn to roles that require creative thinking, strong communication, and problem-solving, and enable me to add new skills to my arsenal.</p>
